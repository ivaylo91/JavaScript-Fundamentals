## JavaScript Function Tasks

### 1.Triangle Of Stars

  * Write a JS function that outputs a triangle made of stars with variable size, depending on an input parameter. Look
    at the examples to get an idea.
  
  * The input comes as a single number argument.
  
  *  The output is a series of lines printed on the console, forming a triangle of variable size.
  

#### 2.Square of Stars

  * Write a JS function that outputs a rectangle made of stars with variable size, depending on an input parameter. If
  there is no parameter specified, the rectangle should always be of size 5. Look at the examples to get an idea.

  * The input comes as a single number argument.

  * The output is a series of lines printed on the console, forming a rectangle of variable size. 

#### 3. Palindrome

* Write a JS function that checks if an input string is a palindrome.


* The input comes as a single string argument.


* The output is the return value of your function. It should be true if the string is a palindrome and false if it’s not.

#### Example

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| haha | false| 
| racecar | true|

#### 4. Day of Week

* Write a JS function that prints a number between 1 and 7 when a day of the week is passed to it as a string and an
 error message if the string is not recognized.

* The input comes as a single string argument.


* The output should be returned as a result of your program.

#### Example

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| Monday | 1| 

### 5. Functional Calculator

* Write a JS program that receives two variables and an operator and performs a calculation between the variables,
  using the operator. Store the different functions in variables and pass them to your calculator.


* The input comes as three arguments – two numbers, and a string, representing the operator.


* The output should be printed on the console.

#### Example

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| 2,4,'+' | 6 |
