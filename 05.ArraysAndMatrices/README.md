## Array and Matrices Tasks

#### 1. Sum First and Last Element 

* Write a JS function that calculates and prints the sum of the first and the last elements in an array.

* The <b>input</b> comes as array of string elements holding numbers.

* The <b>output</b> is the return value of your function.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| [10,20,30] | 40| 
| [10,15] | 25|

#### 2.Even Position Element

* Write a JS function that finds the elements at even positions in an array.

* The input comes as array of string elements.

* The output is the return value of your function. Collect all elements in a string, separated by space.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| ['20', '30', '40'] | 20 40 | 
| ['5,'10'] | 5|

#### 3. Negative / Positive Numbers

* Write a JS function that processes the elements in an array one by one and produces a new array. Prepend each
negative element at the front of the result and append each positive (or 0) element at the end of the result.

* The input comes as array of number elements.


* The output is printed on the console, each element on a new line.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| [7, -2, 8, 9] | -2<br>7<br>8<br>9 | 

#### 4. First and Last K Numbers

* Write a JS function that prints the first k and the last k elements from an array of numbers.

* The input comes as array of number elements. The first element represents the number k, all other elements are
from the array that needs to be processed.

* The output is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line print the first k elements, separated by space. On
the second line print the last k elements, separated by space.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| [<b>2</b>, 7, 8, 9] | 7 8 <br>8 9 |

#### 5. Process Odd Numbers 

* You are given an array of numbers. Write a JS function that prints the elements at odd positions from the array,
doubled and in reverse order.

* The <b>input</b> comes as array of number elements.

* The <b>output</b> is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| [10, 15, 20, 25] | 50 30 |
| [3, 0, 10, 4, 7, 3] | 6 8 0 |

#### 6. Smallest Two Numbers

* Write a JS function that prints the two smallest elements from an array of numbers.

* The <b>input</b> comes as array of number elements.

* The <b>output</b> is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| [30, 15, 50, 5] | 15 5 |    

#### 8. Biggest Element

* Write a JS function that finds the biggest element inside a matrix.

* The <b>input</b> comes as array of arrays, containing number elements (2D matrix of numbers).

* The <b>output</b> is the return value of your function. Find the biggest element and return it.

#### Example 

| Input      | Output        |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| [[20, 50, 10],<br>[8, 33,Â 145]] | 145 |
